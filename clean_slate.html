		<h1 class="modal-title" id="modalTitle">STI/UTI Detection via Microfluidics</h1>
		<p class="mb-2">In America, one in two sexually active individuals under the age of 25 is expected to contract
			an STD. The current process for STI detection takes 2-5 days to deliver results, which is anxiety inducing.
			Current
			costs for testing ranges from $50-$100. Typical point-of-care devices require invasive methods of sample
			extraction, and the
			overall process has a severe lack of privacy.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Clean Slate microfluidic device is designed to be an rapid, discrete, and non-invasive alternative to
			current STI
			testing methods. The process is as follows:
		</p>
		<p align="left">1. 25mL of non-first pass urine is deposited into the device. </p>
		<p align="left">2. The device is placed on a plastic stand, and an app is launched.</p>
		<p align="left">3. A series of LED lights is shown onto the filter for 10 minutes. This acts a
			thermocouple for
			replicating
			the DNA -- think PCR!
		</p>
		<p align="left">4. A push notification will contain the results. </p>

			<p class="col-xs-12 col-md-10">What started off as a microfluidics class project evolved into a venture with
				full support from our laboratory PI Luke Lee. Using his intellectual property on
				nanofiltration, cell lysis, and DNA replication we fleshed out a proof-of-concept microfluidic device
				that we planned
				to use on clinical STI urine. Instead, we were able to test our efficacy against UTI's with some clever
				thinking üòè.
				Since <i>E.coli</i> makes up 90% of UTI cases and is the most common bacterial strain used
				in cloning. We were able to test the efficacy of our device towards detecting UTIs.

			<p class="col-xs-12 col-md-10"> On the experimentation side, I designed the microfluidic channels and
				conducted COMSOL simulations to simulate the
				flow of urine into the device. You would be surprised how you cannot assume urine behaves like water at
				the nano-level. On the business side, I worked alongside Mehek Mohan to pitch our device and
				secure funding. We conducted a full
				competitive landscape to assess the market opportunity, and our go-to-market (GTM) strategy.

			<p class="col-xs-12 col-md-10">We managed to secure $5,000 in funding from UC Berkeley's LAUNCH accelerator
				<a href="https://www.uclaunch.com/">(link)</a>; however, we ultimately decided to not pursue the venture
				further. With our PI moving from UC
				Berkeley to Harvard, we lacked a decent amount of guidance in our main operating expense -- laboratory
				space & reagents. We helped in the drafting of the
				patent process, in addition to being acknowledged on the manuscript.
