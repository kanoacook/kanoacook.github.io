			<h1>Background</h1>
			<h2 class="mb-4">It all started as a class project!</h2>
			<p>3 classmates got together in a microfluidics class with the idea of creating a microfluidic device
				capable of performing
				PCR on a microfluidic device. It just so happened that our professor <a
					href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5362183/">had already done this</a>! <br><br>
				With his help, we had the idea of using PCR to test for the presence of bacterial infection biomarkers
				(Chlamydia and UTIs); however, as
				an undergraduate team, we had a tough time finding a medical collaborator that would give us clinical
				urine samples. This is where we got creative! <br><br>Since
				<i>E.coli</i> is the most prevalent bacterial strain in a urinary tract infection (UTI), we would
				validate our device against this before trying other diseases!

			<h1>The Device</h1>
			<h2 class="mb-4">Introducing CleanSlate</h2>
			<p>CleanSlate is a microfluidic device that filters a patient's urine, simultaneously lyses bacterial DNA
				and
				<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsami.9b23591">performs PCR</a> by shining LED light onto
				a plasmnonic gold nanofilm,
				and then glows upon the presence of a bacterial biomarker. Make sense? <br><br>
				TL;DR, you pee on the device, shine your phone flashlight for 10min, and it'll glow if you have an
				infection.

			<h2 class="mt-5 mb-3">Learnings</h2>
			<p>We quickly learned that having a biotechnology startup is a steep hurdle. R&D is expensive,
				no one trusts you with biohazards unless you can fully substantiate your claims in advance via prior
				research,
				and everyone will think you're crazy until proven otherwise! It was exhilarating. Since our PI was
				moving from Berkeley to
				Harvard, we would have needed a large cash injection if we wanted to keep pursuing this idea further,
				which was a huge hinderance. We
				had looked into the SBIR process for funding or splitting our team into tech-side and business-side, but
				ultimately we decided that we
				could hang our hats and say it was a fun ride since the prospects of life were sounding a lot more
				promising at such young ages. <br><br>
