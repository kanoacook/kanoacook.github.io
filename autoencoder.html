					<h2>Data Engineering üå•</h2>
					<p> I set up a Databricks job to automate a data pipeline to fetch information from OSI PI

			<p>Here's a low-fidelity copy of the dashboard (for privacy reasons) üòé<br><br>
				At the 1,000ft view, a user could clearly see that there was predictability that running multiple
				batches on a single filter
				without maintenence is a terrible idea from the large graph on the bottom. Which, at the time, being
				able to visualize this data was
				already a huge win. <br><br>However, what if I told you we could predict a filter's performance in
				real-time using
				data from all 12 of it's pressure, positioning, and cycle time sensors?

			<h2 class="mb-4">Slow-Feature Analysis</h2>
			<p>Slow feature analysis (SFA) algorithm is an unsupervised learning algorithm for extracting slowly varying
				features from a quickly varying input signal.
				Given a set of batches that display optimal performance, the algorithm would be able to determine how
				much a batch varies from optimal performance. To implement this,
				we set a threshold variance value such that if the filter started deviating from normal performance, it
				would alert users!

			<h2 class="mb-4">Autoencoder</h2>
			<p>An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient patterns and trends of
				unlabeled data.
				Our autoencoder is trained on various ‚Äúgood‚Äù batches, reconstructs them into one matrix, which
				subsequent batches are compared against to determine a ‚Äúhealth score‚Äù. This
				approach attempts to look at the data from a batch as a whole, as opposed to the variance from different
				data points. By providing a separate scoring system, we gave our users
				the ability to have a double-confirmation of poor performance.

			<p>This was a great first data science project with real-world impact! We scaled this system to 3
				international sites
				while maintaining loyal adoption and steady feedback from our user group. From onboarding remotely
				during the pandemic,
				it was refreshing to see how this dashboard was constantly on display in common areas during my on-site
				visits.
